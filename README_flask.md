# flask-calendar

## Introduction

I recently (dec 2017) decided I wanted to opt out from Google services as much as possible. One of the services that tied me most was Calendar. There are not many alternatives, and even fewer web-based. I decided to try using a Trello board with due dates and some labels for a while, but proved to be harder to maintain. Add the lack of a month calendar view, and no support for recurrent/repetitive tasks, and I decided to do good use of a holidays to spend some hours and build a simple GCalendar clone.


### Details

Main calendar view:

Create new task view:

Built with Firefox, intended to work also on Chrome and Brave, should work also on other recent browsers, but I won't ever add support for Internet Explorer.

No Javascript libraries, no CSS frameworks. Of course the corresponding code and styles are accordingly non-impressive, but for such a small project didn't wanted to start adding Bootstraps/Foundations or JQuerys or similar.

No databases, as I don't need to do any querying or complex stuff I couldn't also do with JSON files and basic dictionaries.

Authentication works using werkzeug SimpleCache for storage, which means if the application runs with more than one thread you'll get into problems.

Also intended to be a tiny Flask app so minimal coding and functionality used. I didn't wanted to use AJAX at first but quickly came up to the realization that some paths were actually faster so in the end has a few JS lines.

No tests built as main challenge has been my lack of CSS skills and rusty, outdated Javascript. Controllers are also a bit more fat than I'd like but I was just hacking away logic as required without much pre-planning.


Overall, lessons learned:

- Next project will be Django. What I win in speed building the routing and views, I lose then building validations.
- I suck at CSS so I'll stick to Bootstrap/Foundation. This time what I did works but I've spent more time fighting with CSS than building code.
- I'll give a try next time to turbolinks, to trully try to avoid javascript for tiny projects.

### Changelog

List of new features added to the original project commits

- 2018-02-04: Dockerized project for local running of both web and tests. Status bar to see when there's a pending AJAX request.
- 2018-02-03: Better redirect upon login (and root/index action no longer 404s). Authorization working.
- 2018-02-03: Basic user authentication and authorization. There is no user creation so password needs to be manually created and stored into the users data json (salted SHA256 hexdigest). At least authorization is easily managed just adding authorized user ids to corresponding calendar json section.
- 2018-01-27: Reconvert `<br>` to `\n` upon edition. Cleanup of past hidden repetition task instances (when saving a calendar and month changes). Improved tests (more to come).
- 2018-01-09: Bring back action buttons for small (phone) screens. Improved (less terrible) favicon and colors.
- 2017-12-22: "Hide" button to remove individual instances of repetitive/recurrent tasks
- 2017-12-21: Cleanup of internal data files when a day/month becomes empty of tasks
- 2017-12-20: Basic drag & drop (to change day inside same month of a non-recurring task). Intended only for desktop, probably rough on the edges but working.
- 2017-12-30: Event edition. Mobile drag & drop disabled. Mobile CSS improvements.

## Requirements

- Python 3.5+ (type hints are compatible with 3.5 upwards)

Other requirements are on the `requirements.txt` file.

## Running

- copy `config.py.sample` to `config.py` and fill in.

```bash
make run
```

Sample username is `a_username` with password `a_password`.

## Testing

- Install requirements from `requirements-dev.txt` file.

```bash
make test
```

- To extract code coverage:
```bash
make coverage
```


## TODOs / Roadmap

This are initially the only features I plan to build:

- TESTS! Need to increase coverage and also test the main flask app (zero tests)
- fortify cookie
- double click on event day open new tasks with that day number
- set locale to one setup in config
- error messages
- min and max dates for input type date: min="xxxx-xx-xx" max="xxxx-xx-xx"
- a decent weekday and month day choosers when recurrency is selected
- Yearly repetition? (would need month and day)
- search: simple, just python lowercased search at task titles. think how to represent results, if to go to the month or what
- Multi-day tasks?
- task copy/clone functionality?
